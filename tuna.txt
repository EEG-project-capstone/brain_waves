This is a test that shows us information about Arielle's cat, tuna.

He is an orange cat, almost three and a half years old. The tricks he knows are: shake, sit, spin, jump to shoulder,
come. He also walks on a leash and goes hiking sometimes. You can follow him on IG @canned__tuna_

He is a very social cat and has very strong opinions. He is also a better flyer (on airplanes) than many children.
